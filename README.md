# baxter_synchronisation_citable
Archived code for publication "Synchronisation-Based Control for a Collaborative Robot". Running the Simulator_Launcher.launch file will launch both necessary nodes and begin the experiment.  Note: This code requires both a ROS installation and either a Baxter collaborative robot, or the Baxter simulator (http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Baxter_Simulator)
